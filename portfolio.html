            <p>Catching fish is a two player game where the penguin player tries</br>
            to catch the fish player before the fish can eat all the rainbow food.</br>
            The food the fish eats are counted as one point each. The game has</br>
            three levels implemented through three buttons. If the penguin catches<br>
            the fish, then the fish dies and the player loses. If the fish collects</br>
            all the food, then the peguin dies of starvation and that player loses.</p>
            
            <p>We chose to make 'Catching Fish' because I had seen a similar game,</br>
            and wanted to make our own version of it. The fish and peguin sprites</br>
            and the home page were very successful. However, the walls and line</br>
            barriers were confusing to code. We ended up searching up how we could</br>
            make two sprites collide in scratch. We found one succesful example.</br>
            We then took the peice of code and modified it for our own use. If we</br>
            had more time, we could have adde more sprites and adjusted the wall</br>
            sprites to make it more complicated. Also, the website wouldn't let</br>
            us save, so we would also fix those problems.</p>

            <p>On the left is an example of a peice of algorithm from the game. This</br>
            particular peice controls the movement of the fish. The code starts</br>
            when the green flag is clicked. The if statement tells us that if the</br>
            arrow keys the fish moves in the direction of the arrow depending on</br>
            the value of movement. The right tells us that when it gets the message</br>
            that the easy medium or hard buttons are clicked, the fish moves at</br>
            different speeds. Lastly, the forever loop tells us that it is forever</br>
            checking if the arrows are pressed.</p>

            <h1 id="story">Friendly Neighborhood Robber</h1>
            <p>Friendly Neighborhood Robber is about a small town where three kids</br>
            handle a bakery robbery. Readers choose how the kids react.</p>

            <p>During implementation, we coded the way the story would be displayed.</br>
            Though we did run into some minor problems with the code itself, the</br>
            suprisingly hardest part was thinking of a story that wouldn't be too</br>
            long. Similarly, in the testing phase of the process, the most common</br>
            problem was with the story itself. The coding portion was really cool</br>
            to see, everytime we tested it.</p>
            <p>Putting the story into multiple functions is an example of procedural</br>
            abstraction. It saves the coder time and work by not having to code one</br>
            big peice of code. By breaking it up, the story can have steps and allows</br>
            the ability to easily code in the user input parts.</p>
            <p>One of the other stories that stood out to me was "Benpigmen". I liked</br>
            the cause and effect aspect. The story had a pretty good plot and it had a</br>
            humorous undertone that I liked.</p>
